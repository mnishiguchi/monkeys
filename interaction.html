      Monkeys are haplorhine ("dry-nosed") primates, a paraphyletic group generally
      possessing tails and consisting of approximately 260 known living species.
      Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species
      that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also
      active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be
      intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys.
      Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine
      ("wet-nosed") primates. Like monkeys, tarsiers are haplorhine primates;
      however, they are also not monkeys. There are two major types of monkey:
      New World monkeys (platyrrhines) from South and Central America and Old World
      monkeys (catarrhines of the superfamily Cercopithecoidea) from Africa and Asia.
      Hominoid apes (gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans), which
      all lack tails, are also catarrhines but are not considered monkeys.
      (Tailless monkeys may be called "apes", incorrectly according to modern usage;
      thus the tailless Barbary macaque is sometimes called the "Barbary ape".)
      Because old world monkeys are more closely related to hominoid apes than to
      new world monkeys, yet the term "monkey" excludes these closer relatives,
      monkeys are referred to as a paraphyletic group. Simians ("monkeys") and
      tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago. New world
      monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 millions
      years ago. Old world monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine
      monkeys some 25 millions years ago. Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus
      or Parapithecus [35-32 Million years ago] are also considered monkeys by primatologists.
