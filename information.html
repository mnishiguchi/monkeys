  <p>
    Monkeys are haplorhine ("dry-nosed") primates, a paraphyletic group generally
    possessing tails and consisting of approximately 260 known living species.
    Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species
    that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also
    active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be
    intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys.
    Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine
    ("wet-nosed") primates. Like monkeys, tarsiers are haplorhine primates;
    however, they are also not monkeys. There are two major types of monkey:
    New World monkeys (platyrrhines) from South and Central America and Old World
    monkeys (catarrhines of the superfamily Cercopithecoidea) from Africa and Asia.
    Hominoid apes (gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans), which
    all lack tails, are also catarrhines but are not considered monkeys.
    (Tailless monkeys may be called "apes", incorrectly according to modern usage;
    thus the tailless Barbary macaque is sometimes called the "Barbary ape".)
    Because old world monkeys are more closely related to hominoid apes than to
    new world monkeys, yet the term "monkey" excludes these closer relatives,
    monkeys are referred to as a paraphyletic group. Simians ("monkeys") and
    tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago. New world
    monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 millions
    years ago. Old world monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine
    monkeys some 25 millions years ago. Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus
    or Parapithecus [35-32 Million years ago] are also considered monkeys by primatologists.
